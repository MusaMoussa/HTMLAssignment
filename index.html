    <h1>Journey to Becoming a Programmer</h1>

<h3>This is my documented journey</h3>

<p>I have enrolled in ElevenFifty Academy to begin my journey to becoming a software developer. 
    The journey isn't an easy one as I have to do it while working and caring for my family, 
    but I am determined to ride till the end.</p>
<br/>
    
<p>These are some of the tools I would be needing for this journey</p> 

<ul>
    <li>A laptop</li>
    <li>A monitor for extra screen</li>
    <li>An office space</li>
</ul>

<p>This is the most difficult part of learning somethimg new as it is hard to concentrate. 
    I have found some resources to help with how to concentrate</p>
